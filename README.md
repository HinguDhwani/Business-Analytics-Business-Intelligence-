Business Analytics  &amp; Business Intelligence  Project on ACTION TOUR GUIDE COMPANY

This Project is about Business Analysis for “Action Tour Guides”, a well-established company in USA which develops self-guided tours for the customers. The Company was performing well in USA and so decided to expand business in Europe and thus Ireland was the starting point back in 2019, when the company developed and launched its first self-guided tour app for Ireland.
